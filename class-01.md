## Introductory HTML and JavaScript
-----

What is a script and do i create one :
**"A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer Solve the task programmatically. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help)."**

**"from definition I understand that script is a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor as a compiled program is."**

### How do I write  ascript for a Web Page :

In this point I will dirctly mention this steps from book 
**"It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the JS extension."**

 **"The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created."**

According to cahpter 8 Extra Markup they talk about the diffrent between While loop and do While loop and the difference between them :

1- While Loops

This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true. That condition is a counter indicating  that, as long as the variable I remains less than 10, the statements in the subsequent code block should run. 

2-Do ...While Loop 

is a control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once, and then either repeatedly executes the block, or stops executing it, depending on a given boolean condition at the end of the block.

**"The key difference between a while loop and a do while loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met. "**

HTML Layout is related toThe API or Application Programming Interface, is a defined set of requests that serve as the basis for building a software and application. The API acts like a translator where it transfers communication between the customer's web server and the search database.

In this section, you will meet  two different types of scripts whose code you can make use of when you have learned their API: 
*  A set of jQuery plugins known as jQuery UI. 
*  A script that makes it easier to create web apps called Angular JS.

jQuery UI: is a suite of jQuery plugins that extends jQuery with a set of methods to create: 
* Widgets (such as accordions and tabs) .
* Effects (that make elements appear and disappear) .
* Interactions (such as drag and drop functionality).

AngularJS is a framework that makes it easier to create web apps. In particular, it assists in creating apps that write, read, update, and delete data in a database on a server. 

According to Chapter 18: “Process & Design” ,there are some importants points the I will talk about :

1.Order OF execution :

Order execution is the process of accepting and completing a buy or sell order in the market on behalf of a client. Order execution may be carried out manually or electronically, subject to the limits or conditions placed on the order by the account holder.

2.Execution Context:

Execution context is a concept in the language spec that—in layman's terms roughly equates to the environment a function executes in,that is, variable scope (and the scope chain, variables in closures from outer scopes), function arguments, and the value of the this object.

Types of Excution Contexts :

1.GLOBAL CONTEXT

2.FUNCTION CONTEXT

3.EVAL CONTEXT (NOT SHOWN)
