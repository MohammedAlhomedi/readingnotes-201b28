### HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow
-----
#### HTML Lists
HTML provides us three different types:

* An ordered list typically is a numbered list of items. HTML 3.0 gives you the ability to control the sequence number - to continue where the previous list left off, or to start at a particular number.

* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

#### OverFlow Content 
---------------------
>The overflow property tells the
browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have
one of two values:

>* hidden:
This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box.
* scroll:
This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.
