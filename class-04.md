#### Layout Include 
-----
Building Blocks.

* Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use 
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

* Normal Flow .

* z-index .

> The z-index is sometimes referred to as the stacking context (as if the blocks have been stacked on top of each 
other on a z axis)

* liquid Layouts.

>liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser 
>window. They tend to use percentages.


Functions, Methods, and Objects.
----
A method is a function associated with an object, or, put differently, a method is a property of an object that is a function. Methods are defined the way normal functions are defined, except that they have to be assigned as the property of an object.
